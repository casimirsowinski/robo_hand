Description: Scientific Graphics and GUI Library for Python
 PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4/PySide and
 numpy.
 .
 It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
 Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very fast due to its
 heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for
 2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.
